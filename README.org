#+TITLE: ASCIIVN: An ASCII art visual novel engine written in C
[[https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg]]

* With Nix
  ~nix-build~ will produce the wrapper script, ~bin/run-asciivn~

* Without Nix
** Dependencies
  - libpng :: For loading of PNG files into imagebuffers.

** Compiling
  Use ~cmake~ to generate the Makefiles.

  #+BEGIN_src bash
  cmake -H. -Bbuild                                    # Make separate build directory to have a clean repository
  bash -c "cd build && make VERBOSE=1 && cp ./asciivn" # Build under a bash subprocess in order to preserve pwd.
  #+END_src

** Running
  ~./asciivn~ accepts the following flags:
  - ~--benchmark~ :: Skips through all the choices; picking the first choice
  - ~--file FILE~ :: Changes all foreground images to the provided FILE

  NB: The binaries and the images should be in the same location.
  This is an architectural mishap and should be fixed once getopt is implemented
  or ported to Rust.
